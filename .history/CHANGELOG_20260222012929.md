# Changelog

## v9.8.1

### Fixes
- **[Quest]** Fixed QuestieArrow direction for "Forging an Alliance" (12924). Added an extra objective to speak with King Jokkum, ensuring the arrow points toward the breadcrumb quest start at the beginning of the quest.

## v9.8.0

### Fixes
- **[Quest]** Modified `BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED` to trigger a quest log update and instantly refresh the tracker when items are deposited directly into bags by autoloot bots that bypass standard item events.
- **[Map]** Fixed an issue where "Special Objectives" (e.g., source item drops) failed to check player bag contents upon completion, causing their map icons to linger indefinitely until the main quest was turned in.

## v9.7.12

### Fixes
- **[Quest]** Fixed an issue where tracking icons for dynamically updated custom quests like Peak Predators would prematurely disappear due to sync delays on WotLK servers.
- **[Map]** Resolved a frame pool leak that prevented the yellow Finisher icon from appearing immediately on the map after turning in or completing a quest.


## v9.7.11

### Fixes
- **[Quest]** Fixed an issue where quest objective icons and waypoints failed to clear from the map after a quest was completed or abandoned.
- **[Tracker]** Prevented quests from falsely flagging as complete and wiping tracking data when the World of Warcraft server drops its objective arrays. Fixes "Peak Predators" icons disappearing randomly.
- **[Database]** Corrected an error that improperly identified Item Finishers as GameObject Finishers on custom servers, causing map pinpointing errors (e.g. `[QuestieDB:GetObject] rawdata is nil for objectID:`).
- **[Database]** Appended correct fallback spawn data for the "Thorim" listen bunny (`NPC 30514`) so Sibling Rivalry's turn in/listen point functions correctly on WotLK clients.

## v9.7.10

### Fixes
- **[Arrow]** Refactored Arrow logic to drastically improve target distance calculations and prioritize targets correctly based on the player's current zone.
- **[Arrow]** Fixed a bug where the Arrow would mistakenly point to previously completed objective locations instead of the Quest Finisher's exact location.
- **[Tracker]** Fixed `QuestieDB.IsComplete` edge case returning incomplete incorrectly; now verifies `numFulfilled == numRequired` to immediately acknowledge completed quests while awaiting the server flag.
- **[Tracker]** Resolved false-positive "broken quest log" errors spamming chat on WotLK servers by correctly handling API responses for trackable objectives.
- **[Tracker]** Demoted harmless WotLK objective cache count mismatches from Error to Debug visibility level to eliminate chat spam on login.
- **[Quest]** Fixed quest arrow pointing to the key-drop NPC after using all consumable quest keys (e.g. Cold Iron Key for "They Took Our Men!" quest 12843). When a quest uses a key item that is consumed on interaction, it leaves the bag and `CheckQuestSourceItem` returns false, incorrectly triggering a quest reset that re-drew the key source NPC on the map. Now checks if all tracked objectives are already `Completed=true` before applying the reset, preventing the spurious icon.

## v9.7.9

### Fixes
- **[Quest]** Fixed tracker objective count staying stale (e.g. stuck at 14/16 when quest is complete) when an autoloot bot bypasses the standard loot frame. Registered `BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED` event to force a full quest log scan on bag changes, catching progress updates that `QUEST_WATCH_UPDATE` would normally fire for manual looting.

## v9.7.8

### Fixes
- **[Quest]** Fixed "There was an error populating objectives" error in chat for `triggerEnd` quests with no map coordinates (e.g., "complete N quests in zone"). `_RegisterObjectiveTooltips` now silently returns for `event`-type objectives with no `spawnList` — these have nothing to register a tooltip for.

## v9.7.7

### Fixes
- **[Quest]** Fixed "Missing event data for Objective" error appearing in chat for all `triggerEnd` quests with no map coordinates (e.g., "complete N quests in zone" types). Nil coordinates are valid for server-tracked objectives with no pin — the handler now returns silently instead of logging a visible error.

## v9.7.6

### Fixes
- **[Database]** Fixed "Missing objective data" error for all "complete N quests in zone" quest types (IDs 50151, 50145, 50098, 50100, 50149, 50099, 50108, 50111, 50150). Added `triggerEnd` (`[9]`) field so Questie correctly registers the server-tracked objective without drawing map pins.

## v9.7.5

### Fixes
- **[Quest]** Fixed objective pins/icons persisting on the map after a quest is completed or abandoned. Added `CleanupRemovedQuestsFallback` which diffs Questie's quest log against the game's actual quest log on every `QUEST_LOG_UPDATE` and correctly calls `CompleteQuest` or `AbandonedQuest` for any quest that silently disappeared, ensuring map icons are removed.
- **[Quest]** Fixed re-accepted repeatable custom quests (e.g., Stormforged Scales) not showing objective icons on the map after being accepted a second time.

- **[Database]** Added missing spawn coordinates for Quest 50031 "Stormbound" elementals in Storm Peaks (zone 67).
