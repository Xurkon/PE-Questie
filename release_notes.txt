### Fixes
- **[Quest]** Fixed an issue where tracking icons for dynamically updated custom quests like Peak Predators would prematurely disappear due to sync delays on WotLK servers.
- **[Map]** Resolved a frame pool leak that prevented the yellow Finisher icon from appearing immediately on the map after turning in or completing a quest.
